## Read That Extension

Extension to make links I've read on New Scientist website light grey.

It just adds a a:visited css rule.

Very simple example of how to make and load a simple Chrome browser extension.

To load, go to browser extension options. Put it In Developer Mode and Load Unpacked to browser to folder.
